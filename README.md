Prenki Music Video Contest

This is a simple Contest of Music Video Clips
Some friends can play. First they have to put some youtube music video to a pool, where all the videos are gathered.
Than each day there is a turn to vote. Each player can send a vote per turn.

The calendar have to be designed. There are different stages:
-group stage
-group semi finals
-group finals
-conference finals
-final

In the different stage only the most voted videos can go to the next stage. Kind of knock-out thing.
At the end of the game one and the best music video will win

Have fun
